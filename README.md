You cannot really use this code right now, its useless and its basically in constuction.

The only reason this is public is because i dont feel like paying 100$/year for GitHub Pages

basically just act like this is private, but you can go to the gitHub Page to see basically a preview of the game

do not even ask why this project has so many commits :/
